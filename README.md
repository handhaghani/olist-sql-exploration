# olist-sql-exploration
Structured SQL analysis of the OLIST e-commerce dataset, covering revenue trends, customer behavior, shipping logistics, payment methods, and product performance. This project simulates real-world business analytics use cases using SQL queries on a cleaned dataset.

üìä OLIST SQL Data Exploration - README

Overview
This project documents a SQL-driven data exploration of the OLIST e-commerce dataset. The data was preprocessed and cleaned using Python, and then analyzed using SQL across various thematic areas‚Äîsales, payments, shipping, customer behavior, and products. The objective is to uncover business insights that support operational, financial, and customer-centric decision-making. The analysis also includes a Python notebook that performs text mining on customer reviews to identify word patterns across satisfaction levels.
